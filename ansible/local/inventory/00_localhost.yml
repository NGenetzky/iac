# Inventory synxtax
#
# - Comments begin with the '#' character
# - Blank lines are ignored
# - Top level entries are assumed to be groups, start with 'all' to have a full hierarchy
# - Hosts must be specified in a group's hosts:
#   and they must be a key (: terminated)
# - groups can have children, hosts and vars keys
# - groups are unique and global - if you define a group in multiple locations, Ansible aggregates all the data to the global name.
# - If you define a group as a child of 2 different groups, it will be the child of both, any hosts and variables assigned will not be dependent on the parents, they will all be associated with the group.
# - Anything defined under a host is assumed to be a var
# - You can enter hostnames or IP addresses
# - A hostname/IP can be a member of multiple groups
